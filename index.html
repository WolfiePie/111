<H2> My Bio </H2>
<p> Hello, my name is Jourdyn. There really not much to talk about me. I love drawing since a child, the only thing I could afford at the time. 
I started playing videos at the age 11, got a lot hate from all the males in my family. I grow up at GA, rise and born there. 
I used to have two amazing cute doggies and even a cat that sadly got run over by a car, I cry for 5 months. I'm not really good at introducing myself to people.
I am mostly ani-socail, somehow I do have friends, I honestly don't remeber how that happen. My family always wanted me to be a doctor or in the military. I come from a line of military familys memebers.
from my mother sad, there only two female grandkids, I am the middle child and second oldest of 7 siblings. My mother only had three childran, my birth father only has three babies mamma, three wiht my mother two with the second woman and two with the last one for now.
Yes, I get along with all my siblings but don't really hang out or care for them. Ours feelings to each other is normal (we're chill with each other.) My life is not interesting at all.
I grow up poor, took a long long road to make money and work hard at every job I had. I always love animals. When my mother was finally able to afford a dog. The dog name is Blue and he a jack terror Russell I think pure breed.
The animail pound was about to put him down because Blue didn't like any dogs. Highly cute and vicious but smalls. My sister wasd a huge brat and wanted a dog right there and than and we pick blue to save his life from dying.
Since we had that Blue, he hated kids,as we grow older over time. Blue surprisingly started loving us. As a child with a cute little dog, who ate all my 30 collections teddys bears. Which I was sad but got over it.
I grow up with many problems but didn't care too much because at the end I turn out fine as a adult. I just don't really know how to talk about myself so yeah....</p>

<H2> Schooling </H2>
<p> I been to five different colleges, three in Georgia and two in Rhode Island. I chose New England tech to gi8ve it a try. So for it better than the other colleges I went to. Before you asked. Yes, I only took 2 classes,
I only been in the collehes for one semsters.The last school that I went to was Gwinnett Techical College. I move from it because they claim my GPA wasn't enough for the major I wanted.
And try to get me to take a nurse major instead. They didn't teach me anything.</p>
